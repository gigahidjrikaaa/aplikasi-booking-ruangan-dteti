# DTETI Room Booker
By Giga, Difta, and Daffa

## Description
This is our final project in OOP course, to create a program which uses NuGet Package, and a self-built API. The program aims to help the loaning system of rooms. By using a program, the loaning system should be way more efficient.

## How-To
1. Because the database is not online (it's local), change all of the DataSource of each database to their respective paths. 
2. Open the [Questions API](https://github.com/gigahidjrikaaa/QuestionsAPI) and run it (don't close it). It should open up Swagger UI. This is required for the API used in FAQ.
3. If there are any errors, you should be warned by a message box. If there are none, then the app should work correctly.

## Features
1. Home - Homepage of the app.
2. Account - See what you've put in when you registered.
3. Rooms - Check the available rooms and book them.
4. FAQ - Check the Frequently Asked Questions and ask questions yourself.
5. Contact - You can contact the developers via Whatsapp through the app.
